        <div class="poetry-text">
            <p class="line">I’m not here to give answers.<br>I’m just searching, same as you —<br>with paint on my hands and questions in my chest.</p>

            <p class="line">There’s this white bird I drew.<br>It sits at the open door of its cage.<br>The sky is calling,<br>the world is wide open…<br>and still,<br>it stays.</p>

            <p class="line">Maybe you’d call it foolish.<br>But maybe —<br>maybe it knows something we don’t.<br>We always talk like freedom means flying,<br>like wings only matter when they’re chasing clouds.</p>

            <p class="line">But what if that bird remembers<br>the soft mornings inside those walls?<br>The quiet safety?<br>The feeling of being held?<br>Maybe the cage isn’t chains at all.<br>Maybe it’s just… home.</p>

            <p class="line">We call lines and walls prisons.<br>But sometimes, they’re shields.<br>Sometimes, they’re the arms that hold us close.<br>A voice that knows who we are.</p>

            <p class="line">I painted another piece too —<br>a tiny locked cage, floating out in the middle of the stars.<br>It’s fragile, small, surrounded by galaxies.<br>And I thought… isn’t that us?</p>

            <p class="line">This little planet in an endless universe.<br>We build walls here too —<br>not just to keep people out,<br>but to keep love in.<br>To know where we belong.<br>To have a place that means something.</p>

            <p class="line">But still,<br>I get it.<br>To some people, even soft walls feel heavy.<br>Even the people who love you most<br>can feel like bars.</p>

            <p class="line">That’s what my music tries to say —<br>It drifts between sky and ground,<br>between running away<br>and staying close.<br>Between wanting to fly<br>and wanting to stay wrapped in something warm.</p>

            <p class="line">Maybe peace isn’t always breaking free.<br>Maybe it’s just choosing —<br>choosing to stay,<br>choosing to love,<br>choosing to breathe deeply<br>where it feels right.</p>

            <p class="line">And I guess I’ll always wonder…<br>Is it really a cage,<br>if your heart quietly says —<br>"I feel safe here"?</p>
