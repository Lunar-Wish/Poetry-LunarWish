            <p class="line">What is peace?<br>A quiet sky?<br>A life without storms?</p>
            <p class="line">Or is it holding someone’s hand<br>while the world falls apart —<br>and choosing them anyway?</p>

            <p class="line">They said,<br>“I can’t find peace with you.”</p>
            <p class="line">But I was ready to burn<br>just to be the eclipse<br>that let our light meet,<br>even if only for a moment.</p>

            <p class="line">Pain came like waves,<br>yes — but I never saw it<br>as greater than love.</p>

            <p class="line">Even when it hurt,<br>I believed<br>peace was the hush of her name<br>echoing under a starry night.</p>

            <p class="line">She left —<br>chasing a softer stillness.</p>

            <p class="line">She thought the shadows<br>meant the love was wrong.<br>I thought the shadows<br>were just what made the stars<br>shine brighter.</p>

            <p class="line">Since then, I ask myself:<br>Is peace the absence of pain?<br>Or the presence of someone<br>who makes the pain<br>feel like part of the sky?</p>

            <p class="line">We fight with family,<br>we ache for them —<br>but we don’t walk away.<br>Because love is louder<br>than silence.</p>

            <p class="line">So I wonder…<br>Did I lose her<br>to a different kind of peace?<br>Or did I find<br>a quiet truth among the stars:</p>

            <p class="line">That peace wears different faces.<br>And sometimes,<br>we become the eclipse<br>for the Moon we love —<br>not to block her glow,<br>but to meet her in the only moment<br>the sky allowed us.</p>

            <p class="line">Still,<br>if I could go back —<br>I would choose her again.<br>Choose the ache,<br>the gravity,<br>the starless hours.</p>

            <p class="line">Because peace to me<br>was never perfect silence —<br>It was always<br>just her glow<br>in my orbit.</p>

            <p class="line">And maybe…<br>if I was the Sun,<br>she was the Moon,<br>then in some lifetime<br>she was also my sunflower —<br>turning toward the light,<br>even when it burned.</p>

            <p class="line">Now…<br>I am Sol.<br>I am Solastial —<br>shining in silence,<br>knowing my Moon<br>will never come back.</p>
